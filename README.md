# Basic-HTML-and-CSS
Basic HTML and CSS projects are ideal for beginners to learn the foundational skills of web development. They typically involve creating simple static webpages by combining HTML, which structures content, and CSS, which styles it
Common project examples include creating personal portfolios, landing pages, or small business websites. Through these projects, learners practice organizing content with HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links, while using CSS for stylingâ€”adjusting colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing. These projects help beginners understand the box model, layout techniques (like Flexbox and Grid), and responsive design, setting a solid base for more complex front-end development.
